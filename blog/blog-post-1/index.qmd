*"Digitalization" is the act of converting manual, repetitive, and 
irreproducible work by lifting it into automatic pipelines. Read on to learn 
more on how I work to achieving this vision! And although I talk about my work 
in life science research, I believe these insights can be shared across many 
sectors so that, hopefully, a reader can see their own work through the lens of 
my own!*

**What I have loved working on in 2025 is a pipeline for automation of wet lab 
data analysis.** More specifically, I have used my domain knowledge from the PhD 
to develop an R package handling flow cytometry data: a common methodology in 
life science research that can analyze thousands of cells per second for 
characteristics and classification.

And it is a *really neat methodology* that is used routinely, especially so in 
my field of immunology and stem cell research. However, it currently has a big 
bottleneck: the subsequent data analysis relies on point-and-click, proprietary 
software. Manual processing of up to millions of cells per sample and slight, 
but significant, sample-to-sample variation means that the analysis becomes 
inefficient, subjective, and hard to normalize across repeated experiments. 
Making things worse, it is not an acceptable format for submission to regulatory 
agencies.

So to overcome this, while I was working at Novo Nordisk, I was developing an R
package for clearly defined, reproducible, and automated flow cytometry data 
analysis. It handled everything, from data processing to visualization - and was
my first, serious attempt at package development. And I loved it. Much thanks
to great [resources](https://r-pkgs.org/) available I was able to make my first
package have all the nuts and bolts of the type of packages I routinely install
from Github or CRAN. 

Unfortunately, we didn't get to see it go live in the Cell Therapy Unit as it
was closed this October, following the company's reorganization. But my time at 
Novo Nordisk, and working with great colleagues who championed and pushed for 
digitalization and automation, had peaked my interest - and I could see that the 
need was much bigger than just flow cytometry.

## Why life science research needs more digitalization
We have a big unmet need for digitalization in the life science field. Following
the development over the last decades, there are now many methods that require
specialized equipment and methodology. This has lead to a common problem:
specialized, proprietary software for data analysis. I'm not trying to be
high-nosed saying that everyone should *just do statistical programming*
instead, there is really great software out there that has been absolutely
pivotal to the advancement of the field. But the truth is that the *workflow*
that has been adopted by scientists as a result has some serious issues and
limitations:

- It suffers from **low reproducibility**, with users having to put efforts to 
keeping accurate records of settings used for each piece of data.
- It's **inefficient**, with operators having to spend hours clicking around to
analyze their experiments.  
- It is **inflexible**, leading to resistance to address potential mistakes, 
do necessary changes (e.g. a new SOP or on request from collaborators or 
reviewers), or try novel ways to analyze the data. 
- It **splits** intermediate data processing from statistical analysis and data 
visualization, making them hard to link.
- It creates **data silos**, isolated experiments and/or data types that are 
hard to combine to a collective overview - foregoing their use in statistical 
models or context for LLMs. 

Digitalization - *that I define as the act of creating code-driven pipelines for
data processing* - address all of these concerns, and, when combined with data
visualization, it can do even more. For example, a good pipeline could do live
monitoring of long experiments, identify hard-to-catch bottlenecks or warn about
failing batches early. I believe that digitalization could free up time to
think, read, plan, create, and collaborate.

### How to get there
Many individuals and organization are working towards digitalization and, 
naturally, there isn't a one-way to success here. Here is how I want to approach 
it:

- **Automate** intermediate data processing- it is time consuming, a hindrance
to reproducibility, and, frankly put, boring work. Instead, have automated 
pipelines handle type specific data and save it to a common format that can be 
further processed and/or combined.
- **Develop** relevant statistical programming packages, like the one I was 
working on at Novo Nordisk. Thankfully, a lot of great packages are already 
maintained by experts in their fields - making it a matter of incorporating it
into the pipeline.
- **Organize** data into databases for automatic generation of standardized 
reports, for use in interactive apps or dashboards, and use it for machine 
learning and LLM context. 

Before continuing, let me clarify that I believe the data should *still be
readily accessible to scientists*. This is important, that it doesn't feel like
a loss in control of the scientist: the
automated, digitalized  arm should provide a convenient ground truth for
the scientists that otherwise work with the data. I also want to emphasize that
I believe in open source development of these solutions, to help spread
knowledge, implementation, share best-practices, and make it available as
training data for LLMs.

## My current vision for lab digitalization
This vision has me real excited, and so, while looking for a new job to apply
these ideas, I will test out these principles and solutions with my own 
projects. And I plan to share that journey on this blog.

Here is my current, big picture vision for how to achieve a digitalized data
workflow:

1. New data is moved to a centralized storage (I will use AWS S3).
2. It triggers processing by a dedicated pipeline (running on a 
[cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)).
3. New processed data, in turn, triggers another pipeline to update a dashboard
or web app.
4. The processed data is stored in an accessible format and can be used for 
model development, LLM context, or otherwise downstream analysis.

Here is how I plan to start:

### Pipeline development 
Pipelines control workflows that are triggered upon changes in their source data. 
[![](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/logo.svg){style="float: right;
padding: 20px; margin-top: -10px;" width=225}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)
There are [many pipeline tools](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), 
so which one to chose? Being an R programmer, the obvious start for me will be 
[{targets}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/). With it, I can use my familiar 
workflow to create a network of dependencies that will automatically:

- Track changes in the dependencies (e.g. incoming raw or processed data).
- Re-run the pipeline - but only the parts that need updating, based on a 
dependency graph.
- Will be efficient by using implicit parallelization.
- Will easily be checked using a clear visual map as I set up the workflow.

I will also make sure to have a look at other tools outside of R, like 
[snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#).

### Develop relevant packages for intermediate data analysis 
I will continue working on flow cytometry data analysis within R - but with a 
fresh approach. My new package 
[{flowplyr}](https://hugoakerstrand.github.io/flowplyr/) is not the same as what
I was developing at Novo Nordisk, which was trying to mimic the natural work flow
of a flow cytometry operator (replacing point-and-click with statistical 
functions using sensible defaults). Now, I instead want to get the data 
out of the `flowCore::flowSet` object and into a tibble as soon as possible - 
because: 

1. I want to leverage well-established statistical programming packages (like 
[tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/)), which expects a certain object
type.
2. I want to take advantage of functional programming that is natural to R: by
storing the data as list columns in a data frame, one can easily apply functions
to mutate, model, or visualize the data. 
3. I want to store the data for efficient computing, e.g. using 
[{Arrow}](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/)

### Generate dashboards and web applications
Finally, I will continue to learn how to develop elegant and efficient user 
interfaces. I plan to do so using both dashboards and web applications.

#### Generate dashboards using {Quarto}
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open source publishing system that allows 
blending code with text, images, videos, etc. [![](https://quarto.org/quarto.png){style="float: right; 
padding: 20px" width=200}](https://quarto.org) Additionally, it allows the output 
of several different document types; indeed, this website
was published using Quarto! Leveraging advanced code evaluation is 
[very powerful](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2024/11/04/render-generated-r-chunks-quarto/)
and something I am only beginning to explore.

#### Web applications using {Shiny} 
To make the content into an interactive interface, I'll be using 
[{Shiny}](https://shiny.posit.co/). 
[![](https://posit-dev.github.io/shinychat/r/logo.svg){style="float: right; 
padding: 20px" width=200}](https://posit-dev.github.io/shinychat/r/)
I have previous tried out developing a simple Shiny application for a colleague
at Novo Nordisk, and it was striking how a simple application could save hours 
of clicking around in Excel. I am particularly excited to test 
[{Shinychat}](https://posit-dev.github.io/shinychat/r/) that makes it
easy to add a chatbot to your app. This, coupled with a lot of other great
packages from the team at [Posit](https://posit.co/) will be the foundation for
my work on LLMs to provide the [data as context](https://ragnar.tidyverse.org/),
augment functionality using 
[tool calling](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/articles/tool-calling.html), and 
more.

## Until next time
Underlying all these efforts will be many, many more packages and tools then I
cannot mention in a single post: I will make sure to write out the details
as I develop. With this, I have finished my first blog post - thanks for 
reading!
