::: {#hero-heading}
Welcome! I am Hugo, a life science researcher with a PhD in developmental immunology 
from [Lund Stem Cell Center, Sweden](https://www.stemcellcenter.lu.se/). I also have 
industry experience from pharmaceutical research, having worked as a research scientist 
at [Novo Nordisk, Denmark](https://www.novonordisk.com/).

I combine a strong foundation in wet-lab biology with a passion for R programming to 
**visualize**, **analyze**, and **explore** data, to ensure **reproducibility**, and 
to **automate** complex analysis workflows.
