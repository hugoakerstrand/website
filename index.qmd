::: {#hero-heading}
I work as a researcher in life science where I combine an expertise in wet lab science with a passion for programming to **visualize** and **explore** data, ensure **reproducibility**, and **automate** analysis.

*NB! The website development is on going as of October 2025. Many links are place holders that will be continuously replaced by actual content.*
