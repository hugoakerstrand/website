# Personal website for<br>Hugo Åkerstrand <a href='https://hugoakerstrand.com'><img src='https://github.com/hugoakerstrand/website/tree/main/_files/website/img/website_dump.png' align="right" height="180" alt=''/></a>

My website was made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source
technical and scientific publishing system. I have previously used
quarto for report generation and driver for automatic data analysis, but
this is my first attempt at a website.

As an inspiration, I’d like to extend a special thanks to [Silvia
Canelón](https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia) who has an open repository
for people like me to repo dive.
